## 🪐 About the Game

Begin your career at MIRA, an interdimensional school where aspiring musicians train to harness rhythm and resonance. Build relationships, form a band, and unlock special music and narrative paths as you get to know characters from across time and space—including a wild-west alien guitarist, an edgy angel harpist, and a Victorian bassoonist.

Encore! blends fast-paced rhythm gameplay with branching storylines. Perform in rhythm battles by hitting arrow keys to the beat, explore dynamic dialogue trees, and manage your band’s relationships on and off the stage.
