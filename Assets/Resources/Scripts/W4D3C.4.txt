Just know you could be doing better. Try chasing the stars like Ina.

So... what will you decide to do?

I won't be accepting her offer. I can't betray you like that.

Thanks Howard.

I realized something while we were looking for Ina.
I kept thinking I wasn’t good enough — for this school, for your band, for anything.

But... Cynthia basically staged a dog heist just to get my attention.

Name: PC
That's one way to look at it.

I guess what I’m trying to say is... maybe I am good at this. Maybe I do have something special.

Name: PC
Howard, you’ve always had something special. I think you just had to see it for yourself.

Thanks, MC. For being there. For helping me find Ina. And maybe... for helping me find a bit of myself too.

(Maybe “chasing the stars” really did mean something. Maybe Howard just found his own — the kind that burns quietly, but brightly inside him.)
