The cold wind bites into you as you walk around the school grounds. 
It is somewhat haunting seeing the once vibrant green leaves and shrubs lose their color in the dark of dusk. Everything seems... muted.
As you approach Arial Lake, the wind, paradoxically, seems to calm, the air becomes still, as if waiting for something to happen.

In the torchlight, you can make out some of the people around you. There are about a dozen other students standing in a circle, all wearing dark, crimson robes.
While you don't know any of their names, you have definitely seen their faces before in classes or in the cafeteria.

Ignoring the warning signs and literal red flags, you begin to walk towards the group.

Glad I caught you before you could get closer.
Think you could do me a favor? I need you to walk towards me while curving to your right.
Uhh, how should I say this? Imagine that there is a 10 foot circle around the group. Avoid that circle.

Do what he says.
Walk straight towards him anyway.
