Sprite: EMPTY
BG: Lake
Pauline isn't here. Maybe you should try the lake this time.


Name:  
The lake looks really different at night. 
The pond shines like the face of the moon, not from its reflection, but from the thousands of glowing bugs clinging to its surface.

(Where is that music coming from?)

Name:  
You squint and see Pauline in the distance, sitting near the pond playing her bassoon.

Name: PC
(I should go see what she is up to!)

Options: 
Hey Pauline! What are you up to?
Hey Pauline, the bassoon is sounding really nice!
