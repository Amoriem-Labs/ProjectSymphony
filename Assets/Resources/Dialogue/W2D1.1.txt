Oh, thank goodness you're here. I was getting worried that I'd have to leave Ina alone for the day.

We wouldn't want that to happen. Especially not to this little fluffball.
(That dog is so cute with Howard!)

Thank you again for agreeing to do this on such late notice! He's getting pretty low on fuel and the cafeteria doesn't have dog food. I think they have some in the town!

I usually just lock the door to my room and hope for the best or bribe Sam. That sometimes works.

Anyway, you're a lifesaver. Thank you.

Well you two are definitely getting along. Do you mind if I take his leash off? I know he's more comfortable without it.
