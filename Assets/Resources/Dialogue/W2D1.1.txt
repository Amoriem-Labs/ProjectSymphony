BG: Park

Sprite: Empty
The park is almost empty this early in the morning. A few early risers seem to be making their way through the greenery, but the activity you've come to associate with the park during the daytime is absent. 
It is almost... peaceful.

Oh, thank goodness you're here. I was getting worried that I'd have to leave Ina alone for the day.

We wouldn't want that to happen. Especially not to this little fluffball.
(That dog is so cute with Howard. Something about the two of them just seems to work.)

Thank you again for agreeing to do this on such a tight schedule. He's getting pretty low and the cafeteria doesn't have dog food, but I think they have some in the town!

I can't bring him with me to the store, not after the bubble incident, so I usually just lock the door to my room and hope for the best. Or bribe Sam. That sometimes works.
Anyway, you're a lifesaver. Thank you.

No problem! Just leave this good boy to me. ~He's such a good boy, isn't he? Yes you are.~

Well you two are definitely getting along. Do you mind if I take his leash off? I know he's more comfortable without it.

Options:  
Let Howard take Ina's leash off.
Do not Let Howard take Ina's leash off.
