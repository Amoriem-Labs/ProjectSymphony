Oh yeah, before I leave. Here are a couple of his favorite treats. This should help in getting him to like you.

Name: PC
Thanks! I'll make sure he doesn't get too big from these. ~Yes I will~

Sprinting as fast as you can, you struggle to reach for Ina's leash while keeping up with the escaped dog.
As you get closer, the dog seems to look back at you for a moment, before it starts to run even faster.

Name: PC
(How is it possible for a dog to look this smug??)

Name:  
Sprite: EMPTY
Ina suddenly takes a sharp turn past a line of trees, vanishing from your sight. When you get to the corner, there is no dog to be found.

Name: PC
Haah... haah... haah...
That... dog... is... really.... fast.

You take a moment to calm your heavy breathing after the impromptu workout.

(Okay, where could Ina have gone?)

Name: PC
(He could be anywhere by now... he's small enough to get past the school security, too.)

Name: PC
(Darn it. I'm going to have to look everywhere.)

Ina faces the tree line while standing competely still. His hair seems to stand on its edge as he frowns towards the forest. He's tense, as if ready to lunge.

There's something... off about the forest right now. The leaves move and rustle, despite there being no wind.

(Ina's monster / spirit features get more pronounced, or their eyes glow)

Name: PC
(What is happening? Is something going to come from the forest?)

Name: PC
(Wait, maybe Ina is just protecting the school!)

As Ina runs off again into the distance, you look back at the forest. You rub your eyes, and everything seems normal again.

Name: PC
Darn it!

Ugh. Where could he have gone now?
