How come you're so against your parents?

You see, ever since I was a child they considered me the epitome of perfection.
They held me up on a pedestal no matter what I did.
I was always their "little angel".
That's all that everyone back home is obsessed with.
The idea of life being perfect.
I'm tired of living in their status quo.
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
I came to this school to escape my parent's overbearing love.
And to show once and for all that I am not their perfect child.
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous
But an agent of chaos that will throw this school into madness!

Name: PC
So your parents don't like chaos?

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Neutral
Well...
They were actually quite encouraging of my new aspirations.
They saw my enrollment in this school as making the most of an opportunity.
And told me to come here to "find myself".
But I know who I am already.
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous
I will inflict this school with chaos and show my parents that they can't tie me down with their beliefs.

Name: PC
It sounds like they're actually pretty supportive of you.

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Neutral
They don't understand me.
I need to find someone who truly gets why chaos is needed in this world.

Name: PC
Or you could try to really find yourself, like your parents said.

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Neutral
Hmâ€¦
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
I believe that I will find myself... in the midst of this chaos.
When the school is embraced by madness, then I will truly discover what matters most.

Name: PC
Wow, that's kind of deep, Daylo.

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
Just one of the many complex thoughts whirling around in my brain.

Name: PC
Well, I'm not too sure about causing chaos myself, but I would still like to be friends.

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
Thanks PC, you're a good listener.
I suppose I would enjoy being your friend too.
