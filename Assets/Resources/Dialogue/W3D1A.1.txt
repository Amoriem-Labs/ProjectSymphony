Are you the person this locker belongs to?

Name: PC
No, but-

Name: ??? 
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
Then I'm afraid this is none of your business.

Name: PC
What are you doing to my friend's locker?

Name: ??? 
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous 
Nothing that will kill them.
But surely...
It shall bring chaos and confusion!

Name: ???	
And prove once and for all, that I, Daylo, can break free from the binds of perfection!

And who are you? I don't recall ever seeing your face, so you can't be too important.

Name: PC
I'm PC. I'm actually a new student.

Name: Daylo	
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous
Oh.
Well I suppose that makes sense. Then I shall let you in on my plan.

Sprite: Daylo_Smug
A new student like you must need all the friends you can get.
If you prove you have a mind for chaos, then I suppose I'll continue to lend you the pleasure of my company.

Name: Daylo	
PC, come closer.
In my hands lies the vehicle for madness.
It will unleash terror and confusion upon the owner of this locker, throwing their life into complete disarray.

Name: Daylo	
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
Lay your eyes upon it and witness my dark, chaotic nature!
Name:    
<i> Daylo brandishes a plastic snake, fashioned of cheap plastic and chipping paint. 
Name: PC
...
Is that...
A plastic snake?
Name: Daylo	
Why of course!
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous
But any common student is sure to mistake it for the frightening image of a real snake!
Help me with my plan, PC.
This faux snake will help spread chaos through the school and prove to my perfect parents once and for all that I am NOT like them!

Options: 
Leave them alone.
Help them with their plan.
