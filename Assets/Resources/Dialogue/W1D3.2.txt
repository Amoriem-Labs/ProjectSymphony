Can I ask you something Howard?

What is it?

After class, some students were asking other people to join their band, but it seems like they were already good friends.
Can you just ask anyone to be in a band with you?

That's a good question, I never thought about asking a stranger to join a band.

Sprite: Howard_Shrug
I never really got caught up in the band-making rush, but in my opinion...
You need to hangout with someone at least once before you can ask them to join your band.

That shouldn't be hard for you though - I'm sure everyone will be excited to meet a new student!

When I looked at your schedule earlier, I saw that you and Sam have the same class right now, so hopefully you'll find her there.

Hey you! I'm so glad we're in the same class!

I had this teacher last year and they were soo boring.

Sprite: Sam_Happy
But now that you're here, this class will definitely be fun!

The teacher walks to the front of the room and opens a gigantic textbook.
They proceed to read from it in a monotonous voice, and by the end of class you can barely keep your eyes open.
You turn next to you and see that Sam is fast asleep.

Aw man, I was really hoping to be a good student and take some notes.
MC... do you think you could share your notes with me? Pretty please?

Of course, I'll send you a photo!
Sorry, but not today.
