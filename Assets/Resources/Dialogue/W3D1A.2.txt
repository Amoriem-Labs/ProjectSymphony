Huh? This is a plastic snake!

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Oh my GOD!
You guys, this looks exactly like the snake I had when I was a little girl!
His name was Fluffy and he looked even cuter than this and he was the best snake ever.
This is so cute! I'm gonna keep him as a good luck charm!

Why would someone put a plastic snake in your bag?

I actually saw someone else put the snake in your bag.
Daylo, the harp player.
