Hey Daylo! I didn't expect to run into you here.

Hello PC.
You're coming across another failed attempt to spread my ideas of chaos to this school.

Name:     
<i>Daylo sighs as their wings droop. They look really upset.

What happened?

Well...
I was told that humans could be very allergic to pollen.
So I found the first human I could and gave them a whole bouquet.

Sprite: Daylo_Disgust
But instead of sneezing, they just thanked me and complemented my chivalry!
This is only the latest of my attempts to bring chaos to the lives of others, but I seem to only be able to accomplish the perfect interaction.

Maybe I should just give up and go back to being the perfect angel everyone expects me to be.

Options:  
Maybe that's for the best.
You should try to keep finding yourself!
