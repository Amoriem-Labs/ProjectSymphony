Uh sure, I'll help you out.

I knew you were someone who enjoyed a little excitement in their life.
Now, you may do the honors of unzipping this backpack.

Go forth, little snake. Unleash your madness upon this world.

What do we do next?

Now we flee the scene.
A good agent of chaos never waits around to be caught.
You know the owner of this locker right?

Name: PC
Yes, I do.

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Mischievous
Then I need you to be my eyes and ears for the aftermath.
Comfort your friend as best you can and I will await your candid report of how much chaos we caused.

Name: PC
Okay. . .

Name: Daylo
When you return to me, we shall celebrate with a serenade from my harp.

Name: PC
You play the harp?

Name: Daylo
Sprite: Daylo_Smug
We all do, where I come from. I just happen to be far more proficient than my peers.
I shall grace your ears with my music sometime.
But for now, I must disappear into the crowds...
Goodbye, PC.
Thank you for your help.

Hey PC!

We got tired of waiting so we figured we'd walk to your class and see where you were.

Name: PC
Sorry for holding you guys up.
How's it going?

Sprite: Sam_Excited

It's going SO good!
When I was in class with Roxanne earlier, I raised my hand to answer a question.
I said the wrong answer, but then Roxanne raised her hand and said the right one!
We are such a complementary duo!

Sometimes I envy your positivity Sam.

Anyways, now I have to grab my notebook before we get going to our next class.
