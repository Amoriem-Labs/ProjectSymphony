<i>The town is near-deserted in the afternoon heat. You can smell skewers of meat coming from some stalls along the main road. 
<i>It's pretty cold, and so Howard and Sam are both wearing hats, although Sam's is made of paper.

You'll find a lot of weird things happening here. Whenever someone doesn't want to be spotted by anyone, they come here.
It's a good place for silence.

I came here a lot my first month. And I got rejected from a few bands...

Oh, I'm sorry Sam! You don't deserve that.

It's okay. I'm not that good at guitar. 
That's why Roxanne doesn't like me. 

Options: 
That's not true Sam - you're an amazing guitarist!!
Well then Roxanne doesn't deserve you.
