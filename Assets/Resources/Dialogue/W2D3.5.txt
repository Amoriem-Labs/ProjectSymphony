We've just been sitting here. It's been nice. You can hear a lot of things from here because there isn't a lot of interference.

You reach a small well built into the side of a half-crumbled wall, with chimes hanging from the top.

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Wait! This is the well I was telling you about Howard!
I have to write a wish! Do either of you have paper?

Name: Howard
Sprite: Howard_Uncomfortable
No, sorry.

Sprite: EMPTY
Sorry, Sam.

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
Well I'll have to make due with what I have. Some sticks and my hat should work fine...

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
You guys can't look! This is a private wish.
I'm only allowed to tell you after I wish it.

<i>You turn away, and Howard covers his eyes half-heartedly.

Sprite: Sam_Happy

(That cannot be sanitary...)

Name: Howard
Sprite: Howard_Uncomfortable
Oh... what did you wish for?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
Actually, I'm not going to tell you. I don't think that will help it come true.

Options: 
Did you wish to be with Roxanne?
I think you should never reveal your wishes to anyone until they come true.
