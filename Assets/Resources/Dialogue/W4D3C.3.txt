I know you're humble and all Howard, but you're by far the best drummer at this school.

Well, I wouldn't say that... But how does that explain you stealing my dog?

Name: Cynthia
Sprite: Cynthia_Neutral
It wasn't really stealing, we just took her for a walk and gave her some treats.

But the reason we wanted you to come, was to recruit you into our band.
