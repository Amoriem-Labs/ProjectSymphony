<i> Out of the corner of your eye you see Daylo messing with another student's locker.

It's none of YOUR business, you foolish–
<i>Daylo looks up from their bag of supplies. <i>
Oh, it's you! I knew you would return to aid me in my quest.

I hear you. 
Just like you'll hear the screams of Jerald the accordion player when I'm done with him.

Hmm…

Perhaps I could sway more students to the side of chaos if I were to be well-known.
I accept your offer, MC.
