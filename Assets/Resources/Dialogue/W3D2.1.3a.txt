Sorry about burdening you with all that. Thanks for listening to me though.
It's been a while since I felt like I could let my walls down like that.

No problem. You can talk with me anytime. I'll always lend an ear.

Be careful with that promise. I half talked your ear off this time and yet you're still smiling.
You're a special one, you know?
