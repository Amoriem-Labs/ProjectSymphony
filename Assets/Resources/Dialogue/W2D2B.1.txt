Sam hasn't been leeching off of your notes too much in your class together, right?

Sprite: Howard_Uncomfortable
Last year, we had a morning class together and she slept through every single one.
I basically had to reteach everything to her over coffee after class.

That definitely helped me to get an A, so I'm not complaining.

But if there's one thing I know, Sam is really hardworking.
She practices so much and music really seems to be her passion.

Sprite: Howard_Uncomfortable
Even if a lot of that passion is directed toward Roxanne...

All that said, I'm glad to have her as a friend.
And we're happy to have you as a friend now too, PC.

Thanks Howard. That means a lot.

Any time! Sorry if I went off and rambled a bit.

We should meet up more outside of class.
Feel free to come hang out whenever you have a free moment.
I'm sure that Sam would enjoy your company too!
Good luck in class!

Thanks Howard, I'll see you later!

Actually- Sam and I were planning on going to the town this afternoon, do you want to come?

Name: PC
There's a town here?

Yeah there is. I haven't been there in a while, but there's some wishing well there that Sam wants me to see for some reason.
Come along!

Name: PC
...Alright! Not as if I have anything better to do.
