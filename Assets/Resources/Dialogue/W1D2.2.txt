So this is the Lake. When the weather's nice you can take a swim in the water, but be careful not to go too deep.

People love to take a dip or even fish here! Although, I can never catch anything. 
Pro tip, don't go into those woods over there!
You don't seem like much of a fighter, so the creatures living there would probably be too much for you.

Yeah, I haven't heard great things either. If you want to enjoy nature, just head to the park where we met yesterday.

From here you can get anywhere in the school. Don't ask me how it works - I don't understand either.

What's so hard to understand? You just gotta let the road, or hallway I guess, carry you to where you need to go.

Now that we're here, we can go anywhere in the school. Where would you like to start?

Options: 
Maybe I can see where people rehearse?
The park!
A classroom would be nice before I'm forced in there against my will.
Could we go to the library?
