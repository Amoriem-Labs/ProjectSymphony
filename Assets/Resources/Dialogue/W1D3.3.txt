Oh my gosh, PC look! It looks like drama is about to happen!

Name:  
You look over to see a student slam a big pile of sheet music down on another student's desk.

I quit!

Name: Student 2
You can't quit! We need you!

Name: Student 1	
You didn't seem to need me when you let the trumpet play all over my solo.

Name: Student 2	
I didn't mean it! Please keep playing with us.

Name: Student 1	
No way! I'm going to go find people that actually appreciate my talent.

Name: 
The student storms out of the classroom, slamming the door behind them.

Wow, that was crazy!

Name: PC
What just happened?

Name: Sam
You just saw a band fall apart!

Sprite: Sam_Pensive
When members aren't appreciated within their band, they'll just quit and look for another.
If you're mean to members, or don't play them enough in a performance, they definitely won't like it.

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Be careful! Just as fast as you can make good friends here, you can lose them too!

Name: PC
How can I make sure to keep band members happy?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
Well that's easy! Just be a good friend and make sure they get their moment to shine when you play together.

Oh!
I almost forgot!
Another way to really make band members happy, is by having them play alongside their perfect match.

Name: PC
What's a perfect match?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
It's exactly what it sounds like! Everyone has a musician that your sound compliments the most!
Roxanne and I are a perfect match obviously.
Sprite: Sam_Happy

We just need to play together and then she'll see that I'm the only one for her.

Name: PC
So, I just have to find compatible instruments to play with each other?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_neutral
That's one strategy for finding them, but some matches are more unexpected than you would think.
But trust me, when you have a perfect match playing together, you'll know.

Name: PC
Okay... I think I'll take your word on this one.

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Yay! Howard is waiting for us in the hallway!

Ugh, that teacher is so boring again this year!

Sprite: Sam_Happy
But we'll still have a great time!

So, since we're done with classes for the day, would you guys wanna have a little jam session?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Yes! I thought you'd never ask!

Name: PC
Jam session?

Name: Howard
Sprite: Howard_Shrug
Don't worry PC, it's super casual.

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Exactly! Even if you're bad we won't judge you too harshly...

Name: Howard
Sprite: Howard_Uncomfortable
Ignore her, let's just play a little bit together and it should be fun!

Name: PC
Sure, let's go!
