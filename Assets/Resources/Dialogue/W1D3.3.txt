Oh my gosh, PC look! It looks like drama is about to happen!

You look over to see a student slam a big pile of sheet music down on another student's desk.

I quit!

Name: Student 2
You can't quit! We need you!

Name: Student 1	
You didn't seem to need me when you let the trumpet play all over my solo.

Name: Student 2	
I didn't mean it! Please keep playing with us.

Name: Student 1	
No way! I'm going to go find people that actually appreciate my talent.

Name: 
The student storms out of the classroom, slamming the door behind them.

Wow, that was crazy!

Name: PC
What just happened?

Name: Sam
You just saw a band fall apart!

Sprite: Sam_Pensive
When members aren't appreciated within their band, they'll just quit and look for another.
If you're mean to members, or don't play them enough in a performance, they definitely won't like it.

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Be careful! Just as fast as you can make good friends here, you can lose them too!

Name: PC
How can I make sure to keep band members happy?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
Well that's easy! Just be a good friend and make sure they get their moment to shine when you play together.

Oh!
I almost forgot!
Another way to really make band members happy, is by making sure you have good compatability with everyone.

Name: PC
What does that mean?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Pensive
It's exactly what it sounds like! Make sure you're spending enough time with your bandmates offstage.
And everyone will vibe more when you perform!

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Although if Roxanne and I were in a band together, I bet we'd always play in perfect harmony.

Name: PC
So, I just have to choose to spend time with the people in my band during school?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_neutral
That's one part of it, but you should also make sure to be a good friend to them.
Help them with their homework, ask about their hobbies, or whatever else they need.

Sprite: Sam_Happy
Although I don't think you'll have a problem with that, we just met and we're already best pals!

Name: PC
Ah okay, thanks for the tip. I'll make sure to keep that in mind.

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Oh! It looks like Howard is waiting for us in the hallway!

Ugh, that teacher is so boring again this year!

But we'll still have a great time!

So, since we're done with classes for the day, would you guys wanna have a little jam session?

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Yes! I thought you'd never ask!

Name: PC
Jam session?

Name: Howard
Sprite: Howard_Shrug
Don't worry PC, it's super casual.

Name: Sam
Sprite: Sam_Happy
Exactly! Even if you're bad we won't judge you too harshly...

Ignore her, let's just play a little bit together and it should be fun!

Options: 
Sure, let's go!
Let's do it!
