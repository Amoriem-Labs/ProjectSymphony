That's a good one!
Thanks for humoring me. It's nice to talk to people about things like this.
I will tell you one more thing about the noxsire.
One thing it cannot resist is music. Thats where the "bass" part of it's name comes from. My family always thought it stems from bassoon.
So I often find myself playing bassoon by the water at night.

I hope I can see it one day.

Why don't I help out?
I have my keyboard! And I bet these bugs can help power it up!

You and Pauline quickly grab the empty glass jars she brought and begin catching glow bugs

Previously empty jars slowly start to glow with each capture. When you finish, you hooked them up to your keyboard.

Alright, let's play!

As your fingers glide across the keyboard, Pauline flawlessly follows your lead.
You find yourself playing well into the night, lit by the glowbugs and the moon.
Your song is abruptly cut off by the sound of a glass breaking and bugs flying away.
