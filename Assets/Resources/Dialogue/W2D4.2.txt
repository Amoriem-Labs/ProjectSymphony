You see a student dressed in a cyberpunk style outfit standing on top of their lunch table, holding a MIDI keyboard. 
They smile smugly down at all of the students before opening their mouth to speak.

The student sits back down as their bandmates cheer and clap. 
The other students in the cafeteria seem to have a mix of reactions: some angry, some worried, but everyone seems to be taking this declaration seriously.

Pretty bold of them to declare victory to the whole school...
