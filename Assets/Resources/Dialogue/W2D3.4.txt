<i>The room is well-lit and meticulously clean. 
<i>Ms. A sits down at what looks like a repurposed receptionist's desk, but the rest of the room is empty.

Sit.

How's the first few weeks been going, PC? I know it has to be hard as a transfer student. 

Options: 
It's been... confusing.
Honestly no, it's been great!

Name: Ms.A
Sprite: GC_Neutral
I'm sorry to hear that. It will get better. 
For someone of your talent, it'll all fall into place soon enough.

Name: Ms.A
Sprite: GC_Neutral
Well, that's amazing! Maybe I should've expected such an outcome for someone of your talent.

Name: PC
...What do you mean?

Name: Ms.A
Sprite: GC_Neutral
Well, I just mean that I can tell you're having a little bit of a rough start. Are you in any clubs?

Name: PC
No...
(Does this school have clubs?)

Name: Ms.A
And you don't have many friends yet, do you.

Options: 
I have Howard and Sam!
No...

Maybe you should try to get out there more, PC. You don't want to just wade your way through this school alone.
Take advantage of the opportunity you have by being here.
When else will you ever be in a community of so many incredible artists, all in the same place?

Name: PC	
(Huh.)

Name: Ms.A
Sprite: GC_Happy
Just promise me you'll try a little bit harder to reach... outside of whatever little social circle you have right now.
Try and make some new friends.
If you do that, I know you can leave a legacy here.

Options: 
A legacy?
I promise.

Name: Ms.A
Oh yes! I'm sure of it. 

Name: PC
Alright then...

Thanks, Ms. A.

Call me Aria.

Name: PC
I will try to do that.

Go on, find your friends.
