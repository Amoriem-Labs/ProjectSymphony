Maybe you should try to get out there more, PC. You don't want to just wade your way through this school alone.
Take advantage of the opportunity you have by being here.
When else will you ever be in a community of so many incredible artists, all in the same place?

Just promise me you'll try a little bit harder to reach... outside of whatever little social circle you have right now.
Try and make some new friends.
If you do that, I know you can leave a legacy here.

A legacy?
I promise.
