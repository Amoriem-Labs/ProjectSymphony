A ghostly Image of Sam appears in your minds eye. She is giving you a thumbs up.
You grab the leash from your back pocket and loop it around itself, creating a lasso. With newfound determination, you look at your target.

The lasso goes flying in a perfect arc and comes down around Ina's neck with the inevitability of the setting sun.
The dog seems startled for a moment, before looking up at you. You think you can see something like respect shining in his eyes.
The moment ends, and Ina goes back to his treat.
