You slowly sneak up to the dog, approaching from its blind spot. When you are about five feet away, you tense before leaping at Ina.

Unfortunately, when you tensed, you hit against one of the drum sets just enough to cause a noise. Ina's ears twitch as he turns to look at you.
Seeing your jump, Ina moves out of the way and runs to the other side of the room.
