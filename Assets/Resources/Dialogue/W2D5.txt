Synthia and The Star Chasers walk on slowly, waving towards the crowd. The bassist makes a heart with their hands and pretends to throw it into the audience, who start cheering.

Sam is staring up at the stage, lovestruck, but what catches your eye is Howard: he is bobbing his head to the music.

I don't know, PC, it'd be pretty hard.
We'd have to find two more people.
