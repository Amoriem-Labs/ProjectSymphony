The Rivalsbandians walk on slowly, waving towards the crowd. The bassist makes a heart with their hands and pretends to throw it into the audience, who eats it up.

The Rivalsbandians start playing. It seems like more a single band's concert than a battle.

Sam is staring up at the stage, lovestruck, but what catches your eye is Howard: he is bobbing to the music, his elbows and wrists moving to the beat of the music. He is in the groove.

I don't know, MC, it'd be pretty hard.
We'd have to find two more people. 
And a bassist and someone to play the countermelody at that! Those are the two hardest people to find!
