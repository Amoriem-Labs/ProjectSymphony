Less an insect, more of a "creature of the night".

It's a creature from a tale commonly told on my planet.
While some believe it to be more like a hound, a canine like creature, others think it to be more... insect-like.
The creature lurks in the darkness, is quick to dash away from light and curious eyes, and hides out near bodies of water.
Many people have attempted to find it, to no avail.
Some who were lucky enough to witness it say it ran on all fours, dashing through the woods as fast as a bear.
Other witnesses say it scaled trees like a spider, only dropping down to quickly snatch up its prey.

Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. To me, the noxsire is just like any other insect, a creature just trying to survive.
That's why it is always hiding or on the run
